# bricc.py

bricc.py provides a python wrapper for using the BrIcc conversion coefficient
calculator (T. Kib√©di, T.W. Burrows, M.B. Trzhaskovskaya, P.M. Davidson, C.W. Nestor, Jr. 'Evaluation of theoretical conversion coefficients using BrIcc' Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A 589 (2008) 202-229, <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2008.02.051>).

The python module does no calculations itself, it just runs briccs with the required arguments and processes the output. It requires a working copy of briccs, the slave version of the BrIcc software. This is available from <http://bricc.anu.edu.au/>.

## Installation

The module can be installed with

python setup.py install


## Usage

First import Bricc

```
>>> from bricc import Bricc

```

Then create a Bricc object, for example for a 100 keV E2 transition in Nobelium-254.  The arguments here are those passed to briccs for the actual calculation:
```
>>> iccs = Bricc(102, 100, 'E2')

```

The conversion coefficients and electron energies can now be accessed as dicts, with an entry for each shell. For example, the total conversion coefficient is:
```
>>> iccs.ICC['total']
31.6

```

Or for just the L shell the conversion coefficient is:
```
>>> iccs.ICC['L']
22.6

```

Individual sub-shell conversion coefficients are also available:
```
>>> iccs.ICC['L1']
0.892

>>> iccs.ICC['L2']
13.85

>>> iccs.ICC['L3']
7.83

```

The electron energies (transition energy minus K-shell binding energy) for a shell can be accessed from iccs.E:
```
>>> iccs.E['L']
73.91

```

iccs.shells gives a complete list of available shells (plus 'total'):
```
>>> iccs.shells
['total', 'L1', 'L2', 'L3', 'L', 'M1', 'M2', 'M3', 'M4', 'M5', 'M', 'N1', 'N2', 'N3', 'N4', 'N5', 'N6', 'N7', 'N', 'O1', 'O2', 'O3', 'O4', 'O5', 'O6', 'O7', 'O', 'P1', 'P2', 'P3', 'P', 'Q1', 'Q']

```
Note that this includes both a shell and its components sub-shells.


Attempting to access values for a shell where the electron binding energy is less than the transition energy gives a KeyError:
```
>>> iccs.ICC['K']
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
KeyError: 'K'

```

Calculations are also possible for mixed multipolarity transitions, using the same example as before but with a mixed E2/M1 multipolarity and mixing ratio 0.5,
```
>>> iccs = Bricc(102, 100, 'E2+M1', 0.5)
>>> iccs.ICC['total']
16.71

```
